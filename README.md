This website was built with the following on the front-end:
HMTL 5,CSS &amp; JS .
On the back-end I usedand used PHP for the contact form.
It loaded in each section (Skills or Portfolio) using ajax. So instead of everything being on one page or have several pages, you would load in the respective file , for example skills.php, into index.php using ajax.
It has a mobile responsive navigation for desktops and mobile devices. 
It utilizes ajax for dynamically selecting and unselecting specific menu items and or loading in new pages without reloading the page.
