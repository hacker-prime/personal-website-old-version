This website was built with HMTL 5,CSS &amp; JS on the front-end and used PHP for the contact form. It loaded in each section (Skills or Portfolio) using ajax. So instead of everything being on one page or have several pages, you would load in the respective file , for example skills.php, into index.php using ajax.
